**`Digital Craftsman (Cloud/Photographer/Videographer)`**

I‚Äôm into cloud computing and photography. I build coding projects from scratch ‚Äî planning, designing, and solving real-life problems with code. Currently, I‚Äôm learning and working towards becoming a full DevOps engineer. In my free time, I share my photography on Instagram profile "[Withphotolibrary](https://www.instagram.com/withphotolibrary)".

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Omkar's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   My coding journey started before college, when I picked up Python programming during my 12th standard. Later, I joined VIT, Pune as an Artificial Intelligence and Data Science student, where Python naturally became my first core programming language.
After getting comfortable with Python, I moved on to C++, mainly to practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). While DSA taught me a lot about logic and problem-solving, I realized that solving DSA problems all the time was not something I truly enjoyed. That‚Äôs when I discovered cloud computing, and it became the turning point in my journey. I started exploring Amazon Web Services (AWS) as my main cloud platform. Learning about different cloud services, infrastructure, and how everything connects together fascinated me, and I‚Äôm still on this learning path. During this phase, I also came across the fact that DevOps is a must for anyone serious about cloud computing. That insight pushed me to dive into the world of DevOps tools, practices, and automation, which I‚Äôm currently learning and applying step by step. So far, this journey has been about exploration, growth, and finding the areas in tech that truly excite me ‚Äî from coding in Python, to experimenting with C++, to now building my skills in cloud and DevOps.
